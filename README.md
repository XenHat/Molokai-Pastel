### Molokai-Pastel
===================
#### What is Molokai-Pastel and why should I want it?

##### Short version:

This is an attempt at providing the Sublime Text users the popular [Molokai][4] vim theme and also making my own twist to it.
(The _Pastel_ part is currently delayed until I finish the Legacy scheme.)

#### Long version:

This might get confusing a bit, but try to follow me here:
[TextMate][1] _(and by extension, [Sublime Text][2])_ has a color scheme called [Monokai][3], created by Wimer Hazenberg. 
[Hamish Macpherson][5] made a modification of it, but as far as I can tell,
it wasn't released to the public. However, based on his screenshots, [Tomas Restrepo][6] ported it
to the vim text editor.

When I told [someone I know][7] I was looking for a color scheme, he mentioned "Molokai".
I liked the scheme and I wanted to use it daily. Since I could not find a Sublime Text version of it,
I decided to attempt to rebuild it and provide the results to the Sublime Text Community.

__Note__: This theme was tested in [Sublime Text 2][2] and [Sublime Text 3][8].
