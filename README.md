### Molokai-Pastel
===================
#### What is Molokai-Pastel about and why should I want it?

##### Short version:

This is an attempt at recreating the [Molokai][4] vim theme for Text Mate/Sublime Text and also making my own twist to it.
(The _Pastel_ part is currently delayed until I finish the base rebuild.)

#### Long version:

This might get confusing a bit, but try to follow me here:
[TextMate][1] _(and by extension, [Sublime Text][2])_ has a color scheme called [Monokai][3]. 
Someone (more like [Hamish Macpherson][5]) made a modification of it, but as far as I can tell,
it wasn't released to the public. However, based on his screenshots, [Tomas Restrepo][6] ported it
to the vim text editor.

When I told [someone I know][6] I was looking for a color scheme, he mentioned "Molokai".
I liked the theme and I wanted to use it daily. Since I could not find a Sublime Text version of it,
I decided to attempt to rebuild it.

__Note__: this theme was only tested in [Sublime Text 2][2].
